# Flutter & WebRTC Robotics demo

This is a sample app to show how to connect to and control a remote robot using WebRTC & Viam. 

In order to try this out on your own you must address the TODO in lib/consts.dart by inputting your robots host and API keys.

You can learn more about the hardware and pi setup [here](https://codelabs.viam.com/guide/led-blink/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)
